## My Portfolio

This capstone project is being created by Nicolas Martinez for the completion of the Web Development Diploma Program at BrainStation.

I will create a portfolio app to showcase my skills and highlight the next step in my 20+ years journey providing customer solutions, now turning Automation Builder, and bringing to the table:
* 20 years of experience in Localization & Translation industry
* 7 years of experience as a Technical Product Manager

I intend to approach this project like a product manager would, starting with a vision, defining a backlog, outcome driven and customer centric at every step, but leverage my newly learnt developer skills to execute.

## Project Specs

* React and React Router Dom to write the front end, using CSS3/SASS for styling
* Server: Express.js and Node.js. 
* Multilingual, using [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) library for internationalization, and AI translations
* Using free [n8n](https://n8n.io/features/) workflow automation tool
* Store data in MySQL database.
